# Alphanet : Model Maker

***

Last Updated : Wed, 16 May 2018 21:40:47 GMT

The tool that let's you build, train and optimize any feed forward neural network model and optimizes it for inference on Alphanet Mobile App. This is an an open source project with the aim of bringing Machine Learning to everyone. This Model Maker is a easy to use YAML based Neural network builder and trainer and optimizer.

You just need to tweak all the hyperparameters in the YAML and run a script, and BOOM..! After the training, you will get a Optimized protbuffer ready for inference on Android or ios.

### Current State

***

Currently we support following two architecture :

- Simple Feed Forward Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks

The Simple Feed Forward Neural Network runs on the Simple Runner UI of Alphanet Application while the Convolution Neural Netork runs on the Slate Runner UI.

We will soon add many other models as time passes. If you can't wait, We are excited about your PR's.

### Building a Neural Network

***

Following are the Steps to build your First Neural Network with our Model Maker.

1. Clone this repository or Download the zip

   Run the following on your git bash to clone

   `git clone https://www.github.com/coder3101/Alphanet-model-maker`

2. Install all the requirements of Model Maker by running a simple command from the root of the source code. ( Place where _requirements.txt_  exists )

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. More to come soon....
